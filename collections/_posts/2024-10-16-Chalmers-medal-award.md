Two experts from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) have been awarded medals in recognition of their world-leading research on malaria and other infectious diseases.

The annual RSTMH Medals and Awards celebrate excellence in tropical medicine and global health, recognising leaders and emerging talent who have made significant contributions to the field.

Professor Daniel Chandramohan won the Sir Rickard Christophers Medal for his pivotal malaria research, notably in vaccine development and trials that informed global health policies. An expert in global public health with a special interest in malaria control, his research on malaria chemoprevention in children and pregnant women has shaped global health policies. Professor Chandramohan has also contributed to trials of malaria vaccines, influencing the World Health Organization’s malaria vaccination policies across Africa.

Professor Chandramohan said: "I am deeply honoured to receive the prestigious Sir Rickard Christophers Medal. My heartfelt thanks go to Sir Greenwood for his mentorship, and to my colleagues at LSHTM and across Africa, whose invaluable contributions have greatly enriched my research." 

The Chalmers Medal was awarded to Professor Taane Clark, acknowledging his groundbreaking work in infectious disease genomics and commitment to mentoring the next generation of scientists. Professor Clark has advanced the understanding of how genetic factors influence diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Using advanced sequencing and analytical approaches, he develops  tools that enhance disease surveillance and inform clinical decision-making, training up a large global cohort of exceptional young scientists in these techniques along the way. 

Professor Clark said: “I am honoured to receive this award and grateful to my colleagues, collaborators, mentees, and supporting institutions.  The application of 'omics in global health is advancing infection control, offering the greatest potential impact in high-burden regions. I hope our work’s legacy—building capacity and tools—inspires future researchers to lead ‘omics-driven investigations, ultimately reducing the global disease burden.”

They were nominated by Professor Brian Greenwood and Professor David Mabey. 

The awards ceremony was held at the RSTMH annual meeting in London. You can read the full award list here
