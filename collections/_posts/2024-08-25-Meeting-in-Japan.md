The 27th International Congress of Entomology (ICE2024) will be held in Kyoto, Japan, from August 25 to 30, 2024. Hosted by the Union of the Japanese Societies for Insect Sciences (UJSIS), this prestigious event brings together entomologists and researchers worldwide under the theme "New Discoveries through Consilience." The congress aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and explore the impact of insects on global challenges such as climate change, food security, and health.
The congress also featured an array of specialised sessions, including one on genomic methods organised by our own team member, Emma, where she also highlighted previous work from our team using these methods. This symposium provided a platform for experts to discuss cutting-edge techniques in genomic research, with an emphasis on how these methods can be applied to entomology to address pressing issues like disease control. The three of them also managed to network with other peers and researchers in the field and was a fantastic and enlightening trip for the team.
